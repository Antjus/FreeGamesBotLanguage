# FreeGamesBot Languages
Add your language to the Free Games Bot!

## **How to add my language?**
1. Create a new file with your language code.
     English = en. You will have to create a file called en.json  
2. Copy the contents from the en.json file and paste them in the file you created.  
3. The json file exists of keys and values example: "key":"value".  
     Only change the values of the json file to sentences in your own language.
4. After you translated the sentences create a pull request with your Discord Username,tag and language. We will take a look at it and merge the files into the repository.
